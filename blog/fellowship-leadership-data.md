# Leadership Lessons from the US Leadership Accelerator Fellowship  
*Reflections from a Data Analyst in Public Health*

This year, I had the opportunity to complete the **[US Leadership Accelerator Fellowship](https://ghcorps.org/what-we-do/u-s-fellowship-program-overview/)**â€”a transformative experience that challenged me to grow not only as a professional but as a communicator, collaborator, and systems thinker.

As someone working at the intersection of **data analytics** and **public health**, I often find myself translating complexity into clarity. But this fellowship reminded me that leadership isn't just about insightsâ€”it's about *impact*. Here are some takeaways i'll be carrying with me: 

### **âž• Cross Collaboration is Essential**

With a [diverse cohort](https://ghcorps.org/what-we-do/spotlight-current-fellows/) of public health leaders across different fields. I gained a deeper understanding of how systems, people and policies intersect. Working across interdisciplinary fields is not just valuable, but necessary to create sustainable change. 

###  **ðŸ§  Strategic Thinking in a Shifting Climate**

Public health leaders must be prepared to navigate underfunded systems and shifting political landscapes. This fellowship emphasized tools such as [resilience](https://l2tprogram.org/exercises/the-resilience-plan-the-four-ss/) planning, [managing up](https://www.managementcenter.org/check-ins/) in the workspace, and [human centered design](https://www.designkit.org/)â€“ skills that have already proved to be practical in my day-to-day work.

###  **ðŸ“– Storytelling is a Leadership Tool**

As a data analyst, I know that numbers inform, however, numbers donâ€™t convey emotion. [Storytelling in public health](https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/narrative-course-public-health/) has the ability to  move beyond the numbers and inform with empathy. This experience deepened my understanding of how personal narrative can shift perspective and drive long term sustainable change.
