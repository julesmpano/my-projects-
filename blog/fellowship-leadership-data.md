# Leadership Lessons from the US Leadership Accelerator Fellowship  
*Reflections from a Data Analyst in Public Health*

This year, I had the opportunity to complete the **US Leadership Accelerator Fellowship**â€”a transformative experience that challenged me to grow not only as a professional but as a communicator, collaborator, and systems thinker.

As someone working at the intersection of **data analytics** and **public health**, I often find myself translating complexity into clarity. But this fellowship reminded me that leadership isn't just about insightsâ€”it's about *impact*. Here are some takeaways im carrying as I move forward:

Cross collaboration is essential as we move forward 
With a cohort of public health leaders across a plethora of fields, I was able to learn from professionals from lawyers, doctors, advocacy workers and so many other leaders which strengthened my understanding of how systems, people and policies intersect and essentially how working across these lines can be a catalyst for creating sustainable change. 

Strategic thinking in a shifting political climate
In an ever-changing political climate, strategic thinking is needed now more than ever. Historically public health fields have been underfunded, leaving little room for public health leaders to feel empowered in their roles. With sessions focused on (managing up, receiving and giving feedback, understanding different roles in social change) (summary for this, too wordy) changing the culture around communication proved to be valuable and practical to my current work 

Power of storytelling 
As a data analyst, I know that numbers inform, however, good stories inspire and leave impact. Storytelling and honing our personal narratives was a key focus of this fellowship, I was able to see how stories can shift perspective and inform change. Knowing the power of a good story to create impact
